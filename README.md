Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, Oxie.Club offers a sleek, purple-themed interface that‚Äôs as fun to use as a freshly crafted diamond pickaxe! ü™ì

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally or deploy it to Vercel.
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)
Git
A Vercel account for deployment

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/oxie.club.git
cd oxie.club


Install Dependencies:The project uses CDN-hosted dependencies (React, ReactDOM, Tailwind CSS) in index.html, so no local npm install is needed for the static app.

Run Locally:

Use a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server or Python‚Äôs HTTP server):python -m http.server 8000


Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the site.


Customize the Logo:

Replace the placeholder favicon and site icon (https://via.placeholder.com/32?text=MC) in index.html:<link rel="icon" href="https://your-cdn.com/favicon.png" type="image/png">
<img src="https://your-cdn.com/favicon.png" alt="Website Icon" className="w-8 h-8 mr-2" />


Upload your logo (e.g., generated via Looka) to the project folder (e.g., favicon.png) or a CDN (e.g., Imgur).


Deploy to Vercel:

Push the repository to GitHub:git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main


In Vercel, create a new project, link your GitHub repo, and deploy. No build settings are needed for this static site.
Update the logo and donation link (https://ko-fi.com/oxied_site) in index.html before deploying.



üìö Usage

Browse Servers: Use the search bar, player count filter, status dropdown, or tag selector to find servers.
